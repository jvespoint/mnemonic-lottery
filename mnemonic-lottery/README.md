# mnemonic-lottery
Generates a new wallet based off of a mneumonic phrase & then checks the address balance on the blockchain.

If an address has a current balance, the information is logged to a file: ChickenDinner.txt

Note:
Using API keys for the various explorers may increase the rate at which the app can process addresses.
